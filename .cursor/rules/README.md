# Cursor Rules

This directory contains Cursor AI rules organized by service and general project rules.

## Structure

- `general.mdc` - General project rules (applies to all services)

## Usage

Cursor will automatically read these rules when working in the respective service directories. The rules help guide code generation, refactoring, and best practices.

- `general.mdc` rules apply to the entire project

## Adding New Rules

When adding new rules:
1. Add general rules to `general.mdc`
2. Keep rules specific and actionable
3. Update this README if adding new service rules or general rules
